I am a software developer with focus on Cross-Platform Development.  Currently working as Xamarin software engineer but learning [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) on my free time.

### More Information

I have been writing software since 1979 when I first learned programming with TI-55 calculator in highschool. 
Soon after, I then got an account on [PDP-11 minicomputer](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/a-brief-tour-of-the-pdp-11-the-most-influential-minicomputer-of-all-time/) and started learning BASIC programming.
This lead me to take up Computer Science (CS) in college and even ended up with a Master's in CS.  

I started working professionally in 1987 working on PDP-11 and VAX.  And I did all kinds of software related jobs from programming, to QA/QC testing, to project management and to management. 

As I was looking at how I can get back into programming in 2014, I figured the hottest growth area was mobile.  
And since I was not tied to iOS or Android, I figured why not do both?  My son started making apps using [libGDX/Java](https://libgdx.com/) so I started learning
and building apps and built couple of prototypes for my work.  And then I finally got a real job doing Cross-Platform development starting with [Cocos2d/C/C++](https://www.cocos.com/en/) and then moved onto [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). 
I thought that with Microsoft buying [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin), C# would be the next platform of choice and I fortunately got a job in 2017 to develop Xamarin/C# apps.
