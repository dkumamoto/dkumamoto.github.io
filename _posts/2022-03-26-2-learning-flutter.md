title: Learning Flutter/Dart
---

I found this article [Why Flutter is the most popular cross-platform mobile SDK](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/02/21/why-flutter-is-the-most-popular-cross-platform-mobile-sdk/) in my news feed at news.google.com and it got me looking into Flutter.  After reading around a bit, I signed for [Introduction to Flutter](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/intro-to-flutter) by Angela Yu and found it to be a good tutorial for someone new to mobile and cross-platform development.  The only negative is that the course is out of date and you get some warnings and errors with following some of the examples using the latest Android Studio and Flutter/Dart.
In reddit, there was a post for a new [Flutter Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-flutter-the-complete-flutter-development-course/) and since it was on sale, I figured why not and I tried it and it was recently created so up to date but aimed for beginners.

I have been doing cross-platform mobile development since summer of 2014 on both iOS and Android, and I am currently working as Xamarin developer (since 2017).  A quick launch course for Xamarin developer would be better suited for me.  Maybe I'll make one.

What got me hooked on Flutter is when Angela described and showed how you can quickly view the original source behind the library widget.  I thought, wow, I can go and modify the main source (or at least extend it) to do the kind of things I want to see in a programming language.  What do I want to see?

More in my next post.
