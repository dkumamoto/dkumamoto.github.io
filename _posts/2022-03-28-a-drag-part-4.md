title: Part 4 of drag
---

I've created my [4th drag test code](https://github.com/dkumamoto/flutter-drag4) based on [flutter_gesture_password widget](https://github.com/yubo725/flutter-gesture-password).

I've learned that squares aren't a good idea since it won't allow diagonal gestures.  It has to be circles.

I also learned that for my blog posts to work, I have to add .md to my file extension.
