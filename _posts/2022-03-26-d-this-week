This week, I've been working on how to detect gesture movements so that inputs via gesture can get recognized as commands.

I'm not seeing many good examples (not that I have looked hard about it), but was pretty common in CAD/CAM software as demo'ed in [Applicon CAD System with Trainable Hand-Drawn Symbol Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12BfpFOq6W4).

Why would I know about something about this in the first place? Because I used to work for a company that was called Applicon, renamed as Schlumberger CAD/CAM.

Here's a simple example of dragging around and drawing the movement [Drag example #3](https://github.com/dkumamoto/flutter-drag-3).

In looking for the original examples I started with, I also found gesture password article, which lead me to: [Flutter gesture password package] (https://github.com/yubo725/flutter-gesture-password)
