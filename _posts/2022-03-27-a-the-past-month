After spending few hours going over the 2 courses mentioned in the previous post, I also looked at few videos on youtube and didn't find anything all that much better.

So, I've started working on my own project trying to figure how to create a development environment in Flutter.

I thought that learning drag and drop was important so I googled and found a good example: an answer to [How to move a widget in the screen in Flutter](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63845607).

My working example can be found here: [Drag1](https://github.com/dkumamoto/flutter-drag-and-drop-1)

I also wanted to learn how to do long press and then drag, so I made minor changes:
1. Instead of clicking and dragging, you now have to press and hold before you can drag anything
2. The target box is now drag and droppable, too.
